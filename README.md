## Design & Build Notes

- The case was designed with spacing in mind to accommodate the joystick lever and all wiring.
- Button layout was based on arcade standards using the template from ArcadeControls.
- Screws and spacers were used to provide a sturdy base and good mounting for the top panel.
- Nylon washers were used to reduce vibration and protect surfaces.
- Anti-slip rubber matting was added to the base for stability during use.

## Research & References

- **Joystick and Button Types:** Crown/Samducksa buttons provide excellent feel and feedback. The CWL-303MJ lever offers a loose Korean-style movement with a rubber grommet instead of a spring.
- **Encoder:** The Daemonbite KTRL Arcade is a low-latency, open-source USB controller encoder compatible with PC and many consoles. It provides excellent responsiveness.
- **USB Integration:** The Neutrik NAUSB3 panel mount provides a professional-grade USB passthrough port, mounted on the case for clean external connection.
- **Construction Tips:** Spacer bolts allow for layered construction of panels, and nylon washers help reduce wear on parts.
